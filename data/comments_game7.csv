"Turned off.

At this point as an adult growing up, I can't tell the difference anymore between the NBA, the NFL, and WWE.  
With sports betting involved too now, it's pretty much convinced me, much like the Chiefs debacle with officiating vs other teams, that the NBA is built much like that and is purely entertainment instead of competitive sports.

The lack of foul calling on the reaching and grabbing by OKC pretty much makes me uninterested in watching this Finals. Not only because of OKC, but Indiana did it to themselves too. Pretty much imploded on Tyrese's injury like Boston with Jayson. But besides that, the lack of help defense, lack of boxing out, the constant turnovers and slopball, constantly throwing up bad attempts contested when ball rotation should be done, throwing up threes, it goes on. I think it was preceded by Golden State with the splash bros - other teams just tried to copy the model, along with recreating Big 3's. It's changed the style of play altogether, along with player personality. And for someone who grew up shooting outside in the driveway, I think is seriously wrong with professional basketball versus college, which is seeing its own issues with NIL dictating the current status quo.","nba","r/nba","2025-06-23T02:17:33.000Z","comment","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
