"No.  Although I was in favor of sliding down to like 6 to take Hali.  Never ever would have though he would have slid down to 12 or whatever he did slide to.  I swear if I ran an NBA team he would have been right up there with Ant/Ball/Hali, those 3 and I would have argued for Hali's court vision and shooting over both of them like I argued with fans leading up to that draft.

Drafting Ant was fine, so that's a choice made.  But they had oodles of options that draft with multiple firsts and as soon as I saw Hali pass 5th and 6th pick slots I was raving the Timberwolves should have sold whatever farm they had to in order to slide up and get him.  They should have tried at 6,7,8,9,10.11,12 was it where he finally went?  Trade picks, trade players, whatever just get it done.   Ant plus Hali would have been an amazing core to develop a new team around.  Instead they shuffled a bunch of pieces around to move around a bunch in the later first, grabbed rights to some non shooting guard from Spain again and then got McDaniels.   Who was interesting in late first.   But it appeared they saw ANT as the perfect PG POA guard of the future and picked Rubio back up to, not sure, teach him about less greedy play or something the first year while they also kept trying Culver out.   Before ultimately trading both and getting Patrick Bev.  And so the treks to the playoffs began.

"3 players with double doubles in the pacers tonight 

Out rebounded 56-39, out assisted 24-13, out shot FG and 3pt. 

25 to 7 for turnovers but only gave up 7 more points off them
