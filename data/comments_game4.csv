"For me it’s not about the amount of fouls that were called. It’s the timing and the disparity of which/when. 

That blocking foul on Nesmith shouldn’t have been an and 1 that was a charge. Several missed calls in dort. 

When Indy is taking charge of the game up 7-10 pts all the sudden OKC gets their whistle. It’s not a conspiracy when it appears to happen the whole season. 

Stopping momentum is crucial to the flow of the game. Twice the pacers should have extended the lead to 15ish points but it just seemed like the refs did not want that to happen.","nba","r/nba","2025-06-14T11:10:20.000Z","comment","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me it’s not about the amount of fouls that were called.

"Sure they do, but I didn’t see any egregious calls. Calls I might not like, sure, but that’s every game of basketball I’ve ever watched. If you don’t want to live and die by a called foul you can’t be in that position at the end of the game, and you certainly can’t be missing 3/4 free throws late as 90% FT shooter. OKC had no business being in a game where they made 3 total 3pt, and if you want to explain that all on reffing go ahead, but Indiana had their chances to put them away just like OKC did game 1 and they didn’t. Pacers are a great team and very well may still win the series, but nobody is going to look back at this if they don’t and say the refs handed OKC a championship.","nba","r/nba","2025-06-14T04:40:29.000Z","comment","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure they do, but I didn’t see any egregious calls.

"People who hate SGAs brand of Basketball are the same people who woukd defend their star player if they played like that.

It's ironic when Rockets fans cry about it, because Harden did it and they defended him for it. Knicks fans, Heat fans, Laker fans, Philly fans... I could make a long list of teams have foul baiting players and defending and supporting then like crazy.

Winning isn't about the fairest points, it's about getting the most points. If people are going to bitch and moan about it because SGA does it and does it well then they should do the same when their own players do it. They won't though, because they're hypocrites.

My team doesn't exist anymore, I don't have that bias towards SGA, Halli, LeBron, Joker, Steph, Giannis, etc. I can sit back, watch games and not later go on to cry about how SGA baits fouls while a player on the other team does it without a word said against them.
