"I heard on radio, SGA 12 FT shots again.   Talking heads instantly right back at it again.  ""this was a show of force by OKC led by the MVP and if it wasn't for one Haliburton shot in game one people would be talking about OKC in 4 like we all bet on before the series"".   Also back at it now calling Haliburton trash for only 17 points.  ""don't believe the box score kids, Haliburton wasn't a factor!"" they said.

That's hilarious after hearing the same people suggesting after game 1 that even though his scoring total isn't amazing you have to applaud the entire context of what he's accomplishing and what it does for those around him.  But today, it's ""wasn't a facter"".



STFU idiots!    So many of us are sick of you flip flopping bozos talking.   Just shut up.

Game 1.   SGA didn't get his 12 to 15 FT as usual..    He got 8.  And they lost.  People were actually questioning if having him shoot 30 times was the correct move.   I had to tell them that it's fine, it's just that the refs didn't carry his empty possession failures and otherwise tack on the and 1s enough to make him the efficient MVP version.  But that it sure might come back the next gamed.

  
Sure enough...

Game 2.  SGA gets 12 FT shots.   Boom to the moon, ""efficient 30 pt scorer"""" claims again!

"ffs dude y'all got your asses beat.

shai 38 in game 1, chet going for 6 points, jdub going 6-17 from the field, indy making 46% from 3 and the thunder turning 25 turnovers into only 11 points and you're here rambling the team lost ""because shai didn't get to his magical free throw number"".

Stop coping. Start admitting the thunder is the team to beat. You'll be better off than blaming all your losses on the refs. Even finch who has been calling out refs throughout the entire season didn't do as much during the series as you sorry ass fans, probably cause he knows that ain't the reason his team lost.","nba","r/nba","2025-06-09T13:45:37.000Z","comment","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;ffs dude y&amp;#39;all got your asses beat.&lt;/p&gt;

"I understand what it means in a *literal* sense. But traditionally, that happens when the favored team loses one of the road games (3 or 4) and closes it out at home in game 5. Meaning the series was never really in doubt. Losing game one at home and giving the underdog home court advantage means the series is much more competitive than originally thought. Which is exactly what has happened here. So it *could* still happen, but it’s much less likely than the what normally constitutes a gentleman’s sweep.","nba","r/nba","2025-06-09T02:57:56.000Z","comment","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand what it means in a &lt;em&gt;literal&lt;/em&gt; sense. But traditionally, that happens when the favored team loses one of the road games (3 or 4) and closes it out at home in game 5. Meaning the series was never really in doubt. Losing game one at home and giving the underdog home court advantage means the series is much more competitive than originally thought. Which is exactly what has happened here. So it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; still happen, but it’s much less likely than the what normally constitutes a gentleman’s sweep.&lt;/p&gt;
